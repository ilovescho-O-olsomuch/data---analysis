## 项目数据集的简介

# slogan dataset ：

## Context

"Just do it" (Nike), "Das Auto"(Volkswagen), "High Performance Delivered" (Accenture), "Think Different" (Apple) are some of the all-time famous slogans (mottos/taglines) of the famous corporations. They have left a mark in the minds of the audience. I was curious to understand the thought process behind the slogans, aside from knowing which company has which slogan. These tagline/mottos are a reflection of the company, the organization culture, the psychology and mindset. More than anything else, it is a symbol.

## Content

I acquired the data by scraping off a bunch of websites. I started with scraping the data from slogan-list.com (using basic Python libraries - beautiful soup and requests)
